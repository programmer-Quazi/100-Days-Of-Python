## Instructions

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

e.g.

[https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNRxEaJIWyKHuWI0Lk24t4KuZVyeew:1579706585702&q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow)

**Warning.**  Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

## Example Input

```plaintext
Angela

```

## Example Output

```plaintext
6

```

e.g. When you hit  **run**, this is what should happen:

## Hint

1.  You can put functions inside other functions.
2.  Don't try to print anything other than the length.
