Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

    Under 18.5 they are underweight
    Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
    Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
    Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
    Above 35 they are clinically obese.

"Your BMI is 18, you are underweight."
"Your BMI is 22, you have a normal weight."
"Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight."
"Your BMI is 33, you are obese."
"Your BMI is 40, you are clinically obese."
